utils to make/revise/incorporate:
- [ ] `windowed` function
- [ ] `ndarray` (see stdlib) with default value
- [ ] map with deep deep comparison function (see immutables proposal)
- [ ] lazy generators supporting infinities (see polyfils for iteration helpers)
- [ ] add support for negative indices in ndarrays
- [ ] pretty print ndarray (up to 3Dm by printing diagonally):
  ```
  aa   aa   aa
   bb   bb   bb
    cc   cc   cc
  aa   aa   aa
   bb   bb   bb
    cc   cc   cc
  ```
- [ ] move utils from /algorithms to here and translate to TS for strong typing
- [ ] add `tap` visualizations via proxies to send messages to visualizations, e.g. in a html static element/canvas etc (maybe in pubsub model)
- [ ] `tr` utility to translate character ranges
- [ ] add p-norms for vectors
- [ ] add n-dimensional iterator
