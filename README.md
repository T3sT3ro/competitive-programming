This repository holds different solutions, experiments and utilities I wrote throughout the years in the field of competitive programming.

It's my attempt to organize some of my code which I could later reference in portfolio or use for other projects.

It's still missing the majority (or even all 5+ years) of my solutions from themis and other site, which I'll import here and add editorials if I get some time to do that.

The files and history have been extracted with `git subtree split` from the monorepo with my website at https://github.com/T3sT3ro/T3sT3ro.github.io using [this guide](https://medium.com/@jeevansathisocial/extract-subdirectory-from-git-repository-without-losing-history-3de8aed359a4).
